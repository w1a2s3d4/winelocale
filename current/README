 INFORMATION

 Mysteriously, the Wine project has ignored the needs of international users,
 instead focusing on how to squeeze more frames per second out of
 [Game of the Year Here]. Those of us needing general application support
 have been left to our own devices.
 
 The Wine mailing lists only say to change the LANG environment variable to
 switch the language in which Wine runs. That's good and well, but it does
 nothing to solve massive font compatibility problems stemming from Wine's
 total lack of support for Microsoft's FontLink, the glue which holds Unicode
 together in Windows software.
 
 The solution to this problem is WineLocale, a Python script which is
 designed to immitate Microsoft's AppLocale. It allows the user to launch an
 application in any locale with all fonts in tact. Of course, it cannot fix
 software that is completely borked by Wine to begin with.
 
 It also takes care of a longstanding, pesty menubar problem that has been
 in Wine since time immemorial. WineLocale will read your Gtk settings and
 hack Wine's menubar and font display settings to match--almost. You will
 still have to match up your Gtk color using WineCfg. WineLocale also
 includes options to set 120dpi fonts and enable (limited) font smoothing.

 INSTALL

 Install the package using your choice of dpkg, gdebi or my favorite: the
 double click.

 LICENSE

 The original WineLocale shell script (WineLocale0) was released under the
 GNU GPL. The Python rewrite has been developed under the BSD License. As the
 original was written in DASH script and this implementation is in Python, it
 would be hard to claim it shares any code with the original.
 
 If you must have a GPL-based WineLocale, please go to the archive and get
 the final release of WineLocale0. You are free to modify it in any way you
 so choose, and even to fork it to a new project.
